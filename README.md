# gbdk_rand
The &lt;rand.h> of GBDK is really broken. So, this is an alternative way for generating random numbers using time.h.

The code is inspired from an answer found on Stackoverflow [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12897992/random-number-generator-that-doesnt-use-rand-srand-c-functions).
